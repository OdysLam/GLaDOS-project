# GLaDOS-project
 A personal smart-home project based on Raspberry pi 2

This is the repository of my personal IoT project. It's based on Raspberry pi 2 and built around the webiopi framework. (http://webiopi.trouch.com/)

It incorparates a number of feautures that automate or facilitate tasks in the house( e.g turning on the boiler) and it's slowly evolving to a full-time house assistant. It can manipulate various lightsa and control my desktop computer, via messenger and wit is can even chat with you!(work in progress)

You can read more about it, in my blog (http://odyslam.github.io/) which serves as a comprehensive guide. Please note that the blog has partly documented an older iteration of the project and needs to be updated.

The project is updated every week with various bug-fixes and various improvements. Moreover, I try to improve the quality of the code wherever is possible as also adding more functionality.

I am more than eager to answer any questions

Cheers! :)
