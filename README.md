# GLaDOS-project
 A personal smart-home project based on Raspberry pi 2

This is the repository of my personal IoT project. It's based on Raspberry pi 2 and built around the webiopi framework (http://webiopi.trouch.com/)

It incorparates a number of feautures that automate or facilitate tasks (i.e opening the appartment's door).

You can read more about it, in my blog (http://odyslam.github.io/) which serves as a comprehensive guide.
Currently it's frozen in version 0.1 as I try to bring the blog up to date, after I finish, I plan to add many more feautures so stay tuned.

I am more than eager to answer any questions

Cheers! :)
