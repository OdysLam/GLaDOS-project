# GLaDOS-project
 A personal smart-home project based on Raspberry pi 2

This is the repository of my personal IoT project. It's based on Raspberry pi 2 and built around the webiopi framework. (http://webiopi.trouch.com/)

It incorparates a number of feautures that automate or facilitate tasks in the house( e.g turning on the boiler) and it's slowly evolving to a full-time house assistant.

You can read more about it, in my blog (http://odyslam.github.io/) which serves as a comprehensive guide.

Currently the project is evolving to version 0.2 with a complete re-work of both the server-side modules and web interface. As soon as I finish it I will start documenting it and bringing the blog up-to-date.

I am more than eager to answer any questions

Cheers! :)
